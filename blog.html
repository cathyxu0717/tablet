      <h3 class="Blog-title"> Doggie Parks</h3>
      <p class="blog-content"> Recently I had a great time at Dog World Dog Park at Kannapolis, North Carolina. It is a
        one-of-a-kind dog park!! The 17-acre property features an Olympic size swimming pool, two water slides, an
        18-hole obstacle course, natural pond, rolling hills, a beautiful creek, and 12+ acres of fenced in play space!
        It also provides Pup Cone at the Doggie Concession stand! I love running around the hills over there and eating
        the pup cone.

      <h3 class="blog-title"> Doggie Cake</h3>
      <p class="blog-content"> My favorite treat is the doggie cake from maison de pawZ. maison de pawZ is a New York
        based, Parisian-inspired p√¢wtisseries creating human grade, gluten + grain free dog treats and cakes to
        celebrate all occasions. I had a beef based cake with sweet patato icing for my 2nd birthday. This cake is not
        only so instagramable but also delicious. I was able to share the cake with my friends and have left overs!

      <h3 class="blog-title"> Doggie Daycare</h3>
      <p class="blog-content"> If you happen to be around the chapel hill area in North Carolina and looking for a
        doogie day care. I highly recommend Green Beagle Lodge. My parents drop me off for daycare and boarding over
        there and I absolutely love it! I was able to stay with my small-size friends and enojy a chill time. They also
        have a fairly large outdoor yard that I can run around. The staff were so nice and gentle. The only downside is
        that I heard my human say Green Beagle Lodge is always fully booked.
